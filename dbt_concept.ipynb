    "In dbt, **ephemeral models** are a type of model that are not materialized into their own physical tables or views in your database. Instead, ephemeral models are created as temporary Common Table Expressions (CTEs) within a larger query that will be materialized as part of another model, typically a view or table. They can be extremely useful in specific situations where you need to create intermediate transformations that are not worth persisting or require real-time, context-specific calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use Ephemeral Models**\n",
    "Ephemeral models should be used in scenarios where:\n",
    "- **Intermediate transformations**: You need to create temporary logic or transformations that are only relevant in the context of a larger model.\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Since ephemeral models are not materialized as separate tables, they can speed up your workflow by reducing the number of objects created in your database, especially if the transformations are highly specific to a particular report or dataset.\n",
    "- **Avoiding Redundant Calculations**: When you need to define calculations or transformations that should only exist as part of a specific process and don’t need to be stored independently for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-life Use Case in Product Analytics (User Behavioral Analysis)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you are building a behavioral analysis model in a product analytics scenario, where you track **user interactions**, **sessions**, and **actions** over time, such as whether users clicked on a particular feature, made a purchase, or completed a desired behavior like viewing a product page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Cohort Analysis with Ephemeral Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to analyze user behavior over time by grouping users into cohorts (e.g., users who joined in the same month) and then calculate metrics like:\n",
    "- **Retention rate**: How many users who joined in a particular month came back in subsequent months.\n",
    "- **Engagement rate**: How often a cohort interacts with specific features (e.g., clicks or purchases) within certain time windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate these, you may need multiple intermediate steps, such as:\n",
    "1. **Joining user data** with sessions.\n",
    "2. **Filtering out specific session types** (e.g., only those where users interacted with a feature).\n",
    "3. **Calculating whether the user returned** after a certain period.\n",
    "4. **Flagging specific user cohorts** based on their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "These intermediate steps may involve the same dataset (user sessions) multiple times but in different ways. Here, ephemeral models can help by breaking down the problem without materializing each intermediate step, reducing clutter and performance overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Use Ephemeral Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "In dbt, ephemeral models are defined by setting the `materialized` configuration to `ephemeral` in your model's configuration block:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- models/user_behavioral_cohort.sql\n",
    "\n",
    "{{ config(materialized='ephemeral') }}\n",

    "WITH user_sessions AS (\n",
    "    SELECT user_id, session_id, feature_interacted, session_date\n",
    "    FROM {{ ref('raw_user_sessions') }}\n",
    "    WHERE session_date >= '2024-01-01'\n",
    "),\n",
    "\n",
    "cohort_group AS (\n",
    "    SELECT user_id, MIN(session_date) AS cohort_start_date\n",

    "    GROUP BY user_id\n",
    "),\n",
    "\n",
    "engaged_users AS (\n",
    "    SELECT us.user_id, COUNT(*) AS interaction_count\n",
    "    FROM user_sessions us\n",
    "    JOIN cohort_group cg ON us.user_id = cg.user_id\n",
    "    WHERE us.feature_interacted = 'new_feature'\n",
    "    GROUP BY us.user_id\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    cg.user_id,\n",
    "    cg.cohort_start_date,\n",
    "    eu.interaction_count\n",
    "FROM cohort_group cg\n",
    "LEFT JOIN engaged_users eu ON cg.user_id = eu.user_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Deep Dive Explanation**\n",
    "1. **First CTE (`user_sessions`)**: Extract user sessions from raw data (`raw_user_sessions`), filtering based on the session date.\n",
    "2. **Second CTE (`cohort_group`)**: Identify the cohort for each user by finding their first session date.\n",
    "3. **Third CTE (`engaged_users`)**: Calculate how many times each user from the cohort interacted with a specific feature (e.g., `new_feature`).\n",
    "4. **Final SELECT**: Join everything together, showing the cohort start date and the number of interactions for each user in that cohort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each of these CTEs is part of the final SELECT query, dbt will treat them as ephemeral models. They exist only during the execution of the final model and are not materialized in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Ephemeral Models in This Scenario?**\n",
    "1. **Intermediate Calculations**: Each CTE in the above query is an ephemeral model. These intermediate steps are important for calculating the retention or engagement but don't need to exist outside the context of the final model.\n",
    "2. **Performance**: Since ephemeral models don't generate permanent tables or views, you reduce the overhead of managing those objects, which could be especially useful when working with large datasets like user session logs.\n",
    "3. **Simplicity**: It keeps the dbt project tidy by not cluttering the database with temporary tables that don’t provide value on their own but are necessary for a final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When Not to Use Ephemeral Models**\n",
    "Ephemeral models may not be the best choice when:\n",
    "- **Reusability**: If the intermediate logic or transformations need to be reused across different models, materializing them into views or tables might be a better option.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: For very complex transformations or queries where debugging or visibility into intermediate steps is important, having materialized tables or views might be better for clarity and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In product analytics, ephemeral models in dbt are powerful tools for building on-the-fly intermediate transformations that are part of a larger analysis pipeline without materializing them into separate tables or views. This makes them ideal for scenarios like cohort analysis, where intermediate steps (such as joining user sessions and tracking feature interactions) are necessary but only relevant in the context of a final aggregated result."

    "In dbt, **incremental models** are designed to efficiently handle large datasets by only processing and updating new or modified data, rather than reprocessing the entire dataset each time the model is run. This is particularly useful for tables that are large and regularly updated, such as log data, transaction records, or user activity data, where new records are constantly being added.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use Incremental Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Incremental models should be used in situations where:\n",
    "1. **Large Datasets**: You have a table or dataset that is too large to be reprocessed from scratch every time the model runs.\n",
    "2. **Frequent Data Updates**: Your data is continuously growing, and only new or changed data needs to be processed. This is common in scenarios where you are working with transactional logs, user activity, or event data.\n",
    "3. **Efficiency**: You want to minimize processing time and database load by only processing new data (or updates) rather than recalculating everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Incremental Models Work**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define an incremental model in dbt, you specify a **unique key** that will be used to identify new or updated rows. dbt will use this unique key to determine which records need to be inserted, updated, or ignored when the model is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple flow of how incremental models work:\n",
    "1. dbt loads the initial dataset the first time the model is run.\n",
    "2. On subsequent runs, dbt checks for new or updated records by comparing the `unique key` (e.g., `order_id`, `user_id`, etc.) against the existing records in the target table.\n",
    "3. Only the new or updated records are processed, and the model’s logic is applied only to these records.\n",
    "4. The rest of the data remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Define an Incremental Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "You define an incremental model in dbt using the `materialized='incremental'` configuration. Additionally, you define a `unique_key` to specify which column will be used to detect new or modified records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of an incremental model using dbt in the context of **user behavioral data**, where you’re tracking user interactions or events:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Incremental Model for User Activity Log\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- models/user_activity.sql\n",
    "\n",
    "{{ config(\n",
    "    materialized='incremental',\n",
    "    unique_key='event_id'\n",
    ") }}\n",
    "\n",
    "WITH new_data AS (\n",
    "    SELECT\n",
    "        user_id,\n",
    "        event_id,\n",
    "        event_type,\n",
    "        event_timestamp,\n",
    "        event_details\n",
    "    FROM {{ ref('raw_user_activity') }}\n",
    "    WHERE event_timestamp >= (SELECT MAX(event_timestamp) FROM {{ this }})\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Insert or update new data\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    user_id,\n",
    "    event_id,\n",
    "    event_type,\n",
    "    event_timestamp,\n",
    "    event_details\n",
    "FROM new_data\n",
    "\n",
    "{% if is_incremental() %}\n",
    "    -- Only include rows that are new or updated\n",
    "    WHERE event_id > (SELECT MAX(event_id) FROM {{ this }})\n",
    "{% endif %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Breakdown of the Example:**\n",
    "1. **`{{ config(materialized='incremental', unique_key='event_id') }}`**: This line configures the model to be incremental and specifies `event_id` as the unique key. The `unique_key` is important because it tells dbt which column to use to detect new records. In this case, `event_id` is assumed to be a unique identifier for each event in the `user_activity` table.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`WITH new_data AS (...)`**: This CTE is extracting the new or modified data. It filters for events where the `event_timestamp` is greater than the last processed timestamp in the target table (`{{ this }}` refers to the current model's table, i.e., the already materialized data).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **`SELECT`**: After filtering the new data, it selects the necessary fields for the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`{% if is_incremental() %}`**: The `is_incremental()` macro is used to check if dbt is running the model incrementally. This section ensures that only the new or updated records are included in the query. It filters for records with `event_id` greater than the maximum `event_id` already in the target table.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`WHERE event_id > (SELECT MAX(event_id) FROM {{ this }})`**: This condition ensures that dbt will only insert new records with an `event_id` greater than the largest `event_id` in the already materialized table, preventing it from reprocessing old records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding Key Concepts**\n",
    "1. **`unique_key`**: This key identifies new or modified rows. You can choose a column (or combination of columns) that is unique for each row. In the example above, `event_id` is used because each event is uniquely identified by its `event_id`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`is_incremental()`**: This is a built-in dbt macro that checks if the model is running incrementally. When `is_incremental()` evaluates to `True`, dbt will only process new or updated data (e.g., based on the `unique_key`), and the model will append or update the table accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initial Full Load**: When an incremental model is run for the first time, dbt loads the entire dataset into the target table. After the first run, only new or updated data is processed in subsequent runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performance Benefits of Incremental Models**\n",
    "- **Faster Run Times**: Since only new or updated records are processed, incremental models are significantly faster than full-refresh models, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "- **Resource Optimization**: By reducing the number of records processed, incremental models minimize computational and I/O overhead, which is particularly important when working with large volumes of data.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: For tables that continuously grow, incremental models allow you to scale efficiently without reprocessing the entire dataset every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use Incremental Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some real-life scenarios in product analytics where incremental models can be useful:\n",
    "- **User Event Tracking**: If you’re tracking user events, sessions, or actions (e.g., clicks, views, purchases), you can use incremental models to only process new events added to the dataset since the last run. This is useful in cases where your user data grows daily or hourly.\n",
    "- **Clickstream Data**: For a website or app, clickstream data records user interactions with different features. You can use an incremental model to capture only the most recent interactions (such as new page views or button clicks) rather than reprocessing all historical data.\n",
    "- **Purchase Data**: When analyzing user purchases, you can process new transactions incrementally without reprocessing all past orders, reducing processing time and load on the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Updates in Incremental Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge with incremental models is handling updates to existing data. For example, if a user’s transaction record changes (such as an order being refunded or canceled), the corresponding row should be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inserts vs. Updates**: The default behavior of incremental models in dbt is to insert new rows. If a record needs to be updated, you might need to implement custom logic (e.g., using the `merge` SQL pattern, or by running full-refresh models when necessary).\n",
    "- **Full Refresh**: In some cases, you may want to periodically perform a full refresh of the model (e.g., once a month or after significant changes). This can be done by setting the `full_refresh` flag when running dbt or manually triggering a full-refresh of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "Incremental models are a key feature of dbt that allow you to efficiently handle large and continuously growing datasets by processing only new or updated data. They’re particularly useful in product analytics for tracking user events, sessions, and transactions, where data is continuously added but only a subset needs to be processed at any given time. By leveraging incremental models, you can significantly improve the performance and scalability of your data pipeline."

    "- **Purpose**: `ref` is used to reference other **dbt models** within your project. When you use `ref('model_name')`, dbt will:\n",
    "  - Build a dependency graph, ensuring that models are run in the correct order based on dependencies.\n",
    "  - Automatically resolve the model’s location (schema, database, and environment-specific configurations).\n",
    "- **Usage**: Use `ref` when you want to reference any **dbt model** (e.g., tables created or transformed by dbt itself).\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT *\n",
    "  FROM {{ ref('stg_user_activity') }}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Here, `ref('stg_user_activity')` references a dbt model called `stg_user_activity`. dbt will ensure that this model is run before the model that references it, creating a dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `source`: Referencing Raw Source Data\n",
    "- **Purpose**: `source` is used to reference **raw tables** that are external to dbt (e.g., source data from a database or data warehouse). When using `source`, dbt:\n",
    "  - Tracks the source data lineage, allowing you to monitor freshness, quality, and tests.\n",
    "  - Provides a way to document external data sources in dbt, making it clear where raw data originates.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Use `source` when referencing **raw, external data sources** that dbt doesn’t control, like tables ingested directly from data warehouses or external databases.\n",

    "Partitioning in Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a technique used to divide large datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces called \"partitions.\" This improves query performance, load times, and manageability in OLAP systems, which often deal with high volumes of data for analytical queries. Here’s an overview of partitioning types, techniques, and their use cases in OLAP environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Partitioning in OLAP?**\n",
    "Partitioning in OLAP allows data to be split across different segments based on specific criteria, so only relevant partitions are accessed when queries are run. This helps:\n",
    "- Optimize query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.\n",
    "- Simplify data management (e.g., backups, archival).\n",
    "- Balance data load across different storage or compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Partitioning in OLAP**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Horizontal Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - Divides rows in a table across multiple partitions.\n",
    "   - Commonly used in OLAP systems to separate data based on time, location, or category.\n",
    "   - Example: Partitioning a `sales` table by month so each month’s data is stored separately, allowing queries to target specific months.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vertical Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - Splits columns in a table across different partitions, often used to group frequently accessed columns together.\n",
    "   - Useful when some columns are rarely queried, which reduces I/O by only accessing relevant columns.\n",
    "   - Example: Separating columns with personal details from transactional data in a customer table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Range Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - Divides data based on a range of values in a column, like dates or numeric IDs.\n",
    "   - Ideal for time-based data, where queries often target a specific range (e.g., the last month or quarter).\n",
    "   - Example: Partitioning an orders table by date ranges (e.g., each year or quarter).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **List Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - Partitions data based on a predefined list of values in a column.\n",
    "   - Useful for categorical data, where each category is its own partition.\n",
    "   - Example: Partitioning a sales table by country or region, where each region has a separate partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hash Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - Uses a hash function to distribute rows across partitions, resulting in roughly equal-sized partitions.\n",
    "   - Often used when you need an even data distribution and don’t have a natural range or list to partition by.\n",
    "   - Example: Hash partitioning by `customer_id` to evenly distribute customer data across partitions for better load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Composite Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - Combines multiple partitioning strategies, like range and hash partitioning, to handle complex data distribution needs.\n",
    "   - Useful in large OLAP systems where data has both categorical and time-based aspects.\n",
    "   - Example: Range partitioning by year and hash partitioning by region, which could optimize queries across both time and geographic regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Partitioning Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Index-Based Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - Uses indexing on specific columns to support partitioning, allowing fast retrieval of data within each partition.\n",
    "   - Works well for OLAP systems that require quick access to specific partitions based on indexed columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Sharding**:\n",
    "   - Physically distributes data across different servers or storage systems, useful in distributed OLAP systems.\n",
    "   - Often used with range or hash partitioning to distribute data across nodes in a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Materialized Views with Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - Creates materialized views based on partitions to improve query performance.\n",
    "   - Common in OLAP environments where aggregations are frequently accessed, allowing quick access to pre-aggregated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Partition Pruning**:\n",
    "   - Automatically skips irrelevant partitions at query time based on query filters.\n",
    "   - Supported in modern OLAP engines and can greatly improve performance by avoiding unnecessary scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages of Partitioning in OLAP**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Query Performance**: By reducing the amount of data scanned, partitioning improves the speed of analytical queries.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Manageability**: Partitions can be loaded, archived, or purged independently, which simplifies data management.\n",
    "- **Better Resource Utilization**: By distributing data across multiple partitions, you can load balance across compute resources more effectively.\n",
    "- **Reduced Storage Costs**: Certain partitions (e.g., historical data) can be moved to cheaper storage or archived.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-World Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time-Series Data**: Partitioning sales or transaction data by day, month, or quarter helps analysts access specific time ranges quickly.\n",
    "- **Geographical Data**: Partitioning by region or country for data like customer demographics or sales can support regional analysis.\n",
    "- **Large Fact Tables in Data Warehouses**: Partitioning by dimensions (e.g., date or category) is common in star schema models, where large fact tables are split to speed up aggregations and joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning is an essential optimization in OLAP systems, balancing performance, scalability, and manageability for large-scale analytical workloads."

    "\n",
    "### **1. Incremental Models in dbt**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept**\n",
    "- Incremental models load new or changed data into a table by appending or updating only the latest data instead of reloading the entire dataset. \n",
    "- When dbt runs an incremental model, it only processes rows that are new or modified since the last run, saving time and resources on large datasets.\n",

    "#### **When to Use Incremental Models**\n",
    "Incremental models are ideal when:\n",
    "- You’re dealing with a large dataset that grows over time.\n",
    "- You need to optimize for performance by only processing new or updated data, which reduces compute costs.\n",

    "2. **Sales Transactions in E-commerce**:\n",
    "   - In an e-commerce setup, new sales transactions can be incrementally loaded into your warehouse. Incremental processing ensures only the latest transactions are added, which reduces the load time compared to reloading all transactions daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Social Media Metrics**:\n",
    "   - Incremental models can be used to add daily metrics like post views, likes, or follower counts. This is efficient as you only add new data from each day, maintaining the latest metrics without duplicating prior calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Incremental Models Work in dbt**\n",
    "- You define the model with a `materialized='incremental'` setting in `config`.\n",
    "- In the SQL code, `is_incremental()` is used to control which rows are added during incremental runs.\n",
    "- For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    {{ config(materialized='incremental', unique_key='event_id') }}\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM {{ ref('raw_events') }}\n",
    "    {% if is_incremental() %}\n",
    "        WHERE event_timestamp > (SELECT MAX(event_timestamp) FROM {{ this }})\n",
    "    {% endif %}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, only rows with a `timestamp` later than the last record are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Snapshots in dbt**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept**\n",
    "- Snapshots capture the historical state of rows in a table, allowing you to track changes to records over time.\n",
    "- Snapshots store each version of a row with a timestamp, so you can see when values changed and what they changed from. This is useful for slowly changing dimensions (SCDs), like tracking changes to customer information or order statuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use Snapshots**\n",
    "Snapshots are useful when:\n",
    "- You need a historical record of data changes (i.e., each time a record is updated).\n",
    "- You need to build analyses that depend on tracking how a row changes over time.\n",
    "- Your use case requires auditing or compliance tracking, where it's essential to maintain a history of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-Life Use Cases for Snapshots**\n",
    "1. **Customer Profiles in Product Analytics**:\n",
    "   - In product analytics, customer data may change (e.g., updated email addresses, subscription plans, or status). Snapshots help track these changes over time, so you can analyze customer journey changes or retroactive engagement metrics based on historical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order Status Tracking in E-commerce**:\n",
    "   - In an e-commerce system, an order might move through various statuses like \"pending,\" \"shipped,\" or \"delivered.\" Snapshots help keep a history of these status changes so you can analyze time spent in each status, shipment delays, or patterns in the fulfillment process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Marketing Attribution with Historical Campaign Changes**:\n",
    "   - When campaign or user attributes change, snapshots enable historical tracking of these attributes to attribute conversions accurately based on the data as it was at the time of the conversion, not just the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Snapshots Work in dbt**\n",
    "- Snapshots are defined with a `snapshot` file, which includes configuration for the columns you want to track for changes.\n",
    "- You define a primary key (e.g., `user_id`) and conditions that detect changes (like specific columns).\n",
    "- For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    {% snapshot customer_snapshot %}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    {{\n",
    "        config(\n",
    "            target_schema='snapshots',\n",
    "            unique_key='customer_id',\n",
    "            strategy='timestamp',\n",
    "            updated_at='updated_at_column'\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    }}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM {{ source('app', 'customers') }}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    {% endsnapshot %}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, dbt will create a new row whenever `updated_at_column` changes, enabling you to keep track of historical versions.\n",

    "**Indirect test selection** in dbt refers to a strategy for selectively running tests on models that have indirectly changed due to dependencies. This allows you to focus only on testing the models that might be impacted by recent upstream changes, without needing to run every single test in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dbt, **indirect test selection** is achieved by using the `--select` flag with dependency-based selection methods like `+`, `@`, or `--state`. Here’s how you can implement it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### When and Why to Use Indirect Test Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Indirect test selection is useful when:\n",
    "1. You’re working in a large dbt project where running all tests after each change would be time-consuming.\n",
    "2. You want to validate only the models impacted by changes in their dependencies.\n",
    "3. You’re updating upstream data sources or logic and need to ensure downstream models and tests remain accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods for Indirect Test Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Using the `+` Selector (Upstream and Downstream Selection)\n",
    "The `+` selector allows you to select models and tests downstream or upstream from the affected model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `+model_name`: Selects the model and everything downstream from it.\n",
    "- `model_name+`: Selects the model and everything upstream from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dbt test --select +your_model_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command will run tests on `your_model_name` and any models or dependencies downstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Using the `@` Selector (Path Selection)\n",
    "The `@` selector selects models that are both upstream and downstream of a given model, creating a **full dependency path**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dbt test --select @your_model_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will run tests on `your_model_name` and all models that are directly or indirectly impacted by it, as well as any models it depends on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Using `--state` for State-Based Selection\n",
    "State-based selection allows dbt to identify models that have changed since the last run by comparing the current and previous project states. This method is ideal for CI/CD workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, you need to store the previous state in a directory and use it as a reference. Here’s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dbt test --select state:modified --state path/to/previous/run\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case:\n",
    "- `state:modified` selects models that have changed since the last run.\n",
    "- `--state` points to the directory where dbt saved the previous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Combining Indirect Test Selection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also combine selection methods for more precise control. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dbt test --select state:modified+ --state path/to/previous/run\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will run tests on all models that have been modified as well as downstream models, ensuring indirect impacts are tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example of Indirect Test Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’ve updated a source table that feeds into a staging model, which itself is an upstream dependency for several analytical models. Rather than running every test in the project, you could use indirect test selection to only run the tests on:\n",
    "1. The modified source and staging models directly.\n",
    "2. Any downstream models that rely on the modified model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dbt test --select state:modified+ --state path/to/previous/state\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach minimizes the test suite runtime by limiting it to the models potentially impacted by the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Indirect Test Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: Saves time in large projects by running only relevant tests.\n",
    "2. **Precision**: Focuses on models impacted by upstream changes, improving test relevance.\n",
    "3. **CI/CD Integration**: Works well in automated pipelines where incremental changes should trigger only necessary tests.\n",

    "A Jinja \"Masterclass\" in dbt can help you take full advantage of Jinja’s flexibility and power for data transformations. Here’s a breakdown of key Jinja concepts, advanced techniques, and practical examples to help you use it effectively in dbt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Jinja Basics in dbt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jinja** is a templating language in Python, and in dbt, it's used to generate SQL dynamically. Common Jinja syntax includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables**: Defined with `{{ }}` and often used to reference other fields or parameters.\n",
    "- **Control structures**: `{% %}` for logic like `if` statements or loops.\n",
    "- **Filters**: Allow you to transform data within `{{ }}` or `{% %}` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "-- Selects the column name dynamically\n",
    "SELECT {{ my_column }} FROM {{ ref('my_table') }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Common Jinja Commands in dbt\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ref()`**: References other dbt models, dynamically generating SQL to call a model’s latest version.\n",
    "  ```jinja\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM {{ ref('my_model') }}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`source()`**: References a source table, defined in a `sources` YAML file.\n",
    "  ```jinja\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM {{ source('my_source', 'my_table') }}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`config()`**: Sets configurations for the model.\n",
    "  ```jinja\n",
    "  {{ config(materialized='table') }}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Macros**: Functions that can be reused across models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Advanced Jinja Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Jinja filters are used to transform variables. Here are some useful ones in dbt:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`upper`, `lower`**: Adjusts case.\n",
    "- **`default`**: Supplies a default value if none is provided.\n",
    "- **`join`**: Joins elements in a list.\n",
    "- **`unique`**: Removes duplicate values in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% set column_names = [\"id\", \"name\", \"date\"] %}\n",
    "SELECT {{ column_names | join(', ') }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) For-Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops help you iterate over lists or dictionaries, creating SQL dynamically for multiple items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% for col in ['customer_id', 'order_id', 'amount'] %}\n",
    "    SUM({{ col }}) AS total_{{ col }},\n",
    "{% endfor %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) Conditional Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `if` statements to handle conditional transformations, creating more flexible code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% if execute %}\n",
    "    -- This block only runs when dbt executes the model\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM {{ ref('my_model') }}\n",
    "{% else %}\n",
    "    -- This block runs during parsing (e.g., dbt docs)\n",
    "    SELECT 'Parsing mode' AS status\n",
    "{% endif %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Custom Macros\n",
    "\n",
    "Macros are reusable blocks of Jinja code that you can call within models, which can improve modularity and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a Macro**: Place macros in the `/macros` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```jinja\n",
    "   -- In macros/my_macros.sql\n",
    "   {% macro get_year_column(column_name) %}\n",
    "       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM {{ column_name }})\n",
    "   {% endmacro %}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Call a Macro**: Use `{{ get_year_column('order_date') }}` to call the macro within a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Leveraging Jinja in YAML Files\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use Jinja expressions in `schema.yml` files. This is useful for dynamic testing, documentation, and other configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "version: 2\n",
    "models:\n",
    "  - name: my_model\n",
    "    description: \"A dynamically documented model\"\n",
    "    columns:\n",
    "      {% for col in ['customer_id', 'order_id', 'total_amount'] %}\n",
    "      - name: {{ col }}\n",
    "        description: \"This is the {{ col }} column\"\n",
    "      {% endfor %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Using Jinja for Complex Logic in dbt\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) Dynamically Generating Columns\n",
    "If you need to generate a list of columns dynamically, use a Jinja `for` loop to simplify your SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% set columns = ['customer_id', 'order_id', 'amount'] %}\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    {% for col in columns %}\n",
    "        {{ col }} AS {{ col }}_alias\n",
    "        {% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}\n",
    "    {% endfor %}\n",
    "FROM {{ ref('my_table') }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Looping with Conditions\n",
    "You can combine loops and conditions to create more complex logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% for status in ['new', 'completed', 'canceled'] %}\n",
    "    COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status = '{{ status }}' THEN 1 END) AS {{ status }}_orders,\n",
    "{% endfor %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Jinja Debugging Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `log()` function to output messages in your dbt logs, which helps with debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% set my_value = 'hello' %}\n",
    "{{ log(\"My value is: \" ~ my_value, info=True) }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print `My value is: hello` in the dbt logs, allowing you to track your Jinja variables and troubleshoot issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Example Workflow: Dynamic Partitioned Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have a set of monthly partitions that you want to select dynamically based on the current date.\n",
    "\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% set months = [0, -1, -2, -3] %}\n",

    "### 1. Handling Dynamic Dates for Rolling Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you need to generate a table that contains the last 12 months of data, dynamically updated based on the current date.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% set last_12_months = [] %}\n",
    "{% for i in range(12) %}\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Creating Columns Based on Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have various `order_status` values (`new`, `processing`, `shipped`, `completed`, `returned`) and want to generate counts for each. Rather than hard-coding each status, let’s dynamically generate these columns.\n",
    "\n",

    "```jinja\n",
    "{% set statuses = ['new', 'processing', 'shipped', 'completed', 'returned'] %}\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dynamic Filtering Based on Geography or Demographics\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have a table `customers` that includes customer `region`, and you want to create a model that adapts based on a selected region list. This example would dynamically filter customers by their region based on a configuration in the model.\n",

    "### 4. Generating a Time Dimension Table\n",
    "\n",
    "A common task is to create a date or time dimension table that covers a broad date range. Instead of manually writing each date, let’s use Jinja to loop and generate a date range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% set start_date = '2022-01-01' %}\n",
    "{% set end_date = '2023-01-01' %}\n",
    "{% set date_range = [] %}\n",

    "\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    {{ date_range | join(\" UNION ALL SELECT \") }} AS date\n",

    "### 5. User Behavior Analysis by Segment\n",
    "\n",
    "For a user behavior analysis, you might want to group users into segments (e.g., active, dormant, high-spender) based on specific conditions, with flexible definitions you can adjust without changing the SQL logic in every instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% set segments = {\n",
    "    'high_spender': \"total_spent > 500\",\n",
    "    'active_user': \"last_login >= current_date - interval '30 days'\",\n",

    "        {% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}\n",
    "    {% endfor %}\n",

    "### 6. Aggregating Metrics Across Different Time Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "For some models, you might want to calculate metrics over multiple time windows (e.g., last 7, 30, and 90 days). This can be tedious to do manually, but Jinja loops make it much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% set time_windows = [7, 30, 90] %}\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT \n",

    "    {% for days in time_windows %}\n",
    "        COUNT(CASE WHEN order_date >= current_date - interval '{{ days }} days' THEN 1 END) AS orders_last_{{ days }}_days\n",
    "        {% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}\n",
    "    {% endfor %}\n",
    "FROM {{ ref('orders') }}\n",
    "GROUP BY customer_id\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Automatically Generating Documentation in Schema YAML\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have fields in a model with descriptions that follow a similar format. You can use Jinja to dynamically document fields based on a predefined list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "version: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "models:\n",
    "  - name: customer_orders\n",
    "    description: \"A model representing customer orders.\"\n",
    "    columns:\n",
    "      {% for col in [\n",
    "          {'name': 'customer_id', 'desc': 'The unique identifier for a customer'},\n",
    "          {'name': 'order_id', 'desc': 'The unique identifier for an order'},\n",
    "          {'name': 'order_date', 'desc': 'The date the order was placed'}\n",

    "        description: \"{{ col.desc }}\"\n",
    "      {% endfor %}\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. **`| default` Filter**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `default` filter provides a default value if the variable is `None` or undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "```jinja\n",
    "{% set region = region | default('Unknown') %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "If `region` is undefined or `None`, it will default to `\"Unknown\"`. This is particularly useful when handling optional or missing values in dbt.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. **`| upper` and `| lower` Filters**\n",
    "\n",
    "These filters change the case of strings, often used for standardizing data.\n",
