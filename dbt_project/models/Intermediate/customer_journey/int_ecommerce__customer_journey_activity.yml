      This ephemeral model maps raw event types to descriptive customer activities, forming the foundation for analyzing user interactions across their journey.
      It ensures a clean and meaningful representation of events like purchases, cart additions, cancellations, and product views, ordered by their timestamp 
      and session ID. This model is an integral part of building the customer journey.
